_JAVA is high level programming language create by Jame'e Gosling in "Sun MicroSystem" Since 1991 by name Oak that rename Java in 1995. Java is Pure Object Oriented Programming Language. Actually java is not like all programming language that execute in such system that they compiled | interpret._


### JDK (Java Developement Kit)

 it is group of kit for developement the java program & testing.

 JDK
 |
 --- Compilers.
 |
 --- Interpreters.
 |
 --- Debuggers.
 |
 --- Disassembler.
 |
 --- Documentation Generator.
 |
 --- Header & Subtitle Generator.
 |
 --- Packages & Classes.
 |
 --- JRE & JVM.

#### Download JDK by Oracle

you are diractly download JDK by **ORACLE** offical website that is <https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/> 

### Execute Java Code

> Primary compile the java "source_code" that return bytecode that bytecode same as inside classname mean number of class equal to return number of bytecode

```bash

 javac source_file_name.java

```
> Secondary interpret the java "btye_Code" that execute in **JRE** by **JVM**. 

```bash

 javac bytecode_name
 
```

> For explore structure of bytecode use java disassembler

```bash

 javap bytecode_name
 
```

### JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

 it is the environment that time java is execute the bytecode and give output.

### JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

 it is software program that is perform as virtual hardware device.
 it compiled byte code that run in every Operating System { Linux | MacBook | Windows } that need to execute JRE only.
 all language is execute in bit(1 and 0) but java is execute in byte(8 bit) at time.
